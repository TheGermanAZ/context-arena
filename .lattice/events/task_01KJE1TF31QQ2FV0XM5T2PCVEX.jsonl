{"actor":"agent:gpt-5-reviewer","data":{"body":"Review pass. Verified acceptance criteria: (1) manifest writes are now wrapped in writeManifestSafely() so failures log warnings and do not abort benchmark completion, (2) root test script now runs via cd src && bun test for stable invocation, (3) added dashboard/src/lib/api.test.ts covering non-2xx and schema-validation failure paths with endpoint/path context assertions. Also fixed two analysis modules to avoid import-time main() execution and made src/utils/llm.ts lazy-init the OpenAI client to prevent import-time credential failures during tests. Validation: bun run check passed (root tests, dashboard tests, lint, and dashboard build).","role":"review"},"id":"ev_01KJE2154RCB6N9RY75AES4W9M","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJE1TF31QQ2FV0XM5T2PCVEX","ts":"2026-02-26T22:45:06Z","type":"comment_added"}
