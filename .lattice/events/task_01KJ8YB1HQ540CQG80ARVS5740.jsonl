{"actor":"human:german","data":{"body":"Instrument the RLM sub-LLM to capture its output at each compression cycle. Diff against ground truth to measure what types of information decay fastest: phone numbers, relationships, quantities, temporal ordering, etc. We already proved RLM drops early facts (budget + project lead lost on Early Fact Recall). This task systematically categorizes the loss. Cheap to run \u2014 just add logging to the existing benchmark harness and run across all 8 scenarios."},"id":"ev_01KJ8YBCD5HSX4EAVMPRKMAZPW","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJ8YB1HQ540CQG80ARVS5740","ts":"2026-02-24T23:04:35Z","type":"comment_added"}
