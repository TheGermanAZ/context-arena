{"actor":"agent:gpt5-reviewer","data":{"body":"Review pass for CTX-22 (Days 3-5). Day 3 complete: added Vitest + Testing Library in dashboard, smoke tests for Leaderboard and TokenCost, and focus interaction assertion via row click; root check now runs dashboard:test so CI quality-gate includes dashboard tests automatically. Day 4 complete: added Zod runtime schemas (dashboard/src/lib/schemas.ts) and endpoint-aware parsing in fetchJson with fail-fast validation errors in dashboard/src/lib/api.ts. Day 5 complete: benchmark runner now writes sidecar manifest files with git SHA, filters (including seed), selected strategies/scenarios, timing, and run totals in src/index.ts. Verification: bun run check passed (root tests + dashboard tests + dashboard lint + dashboard build). Manifest behavior spot-checked with a no-op run, producing results/benchmark-1772144427265.manifest.json and console log path.","role":"review"},"id":"ev_01KJE0MVAEJWRDXTPCJN5HGZNQ","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJE0CJP2PHZP6NJ6M1EJQWKH","ts":"2026-02-26T22:20:54Z","type":"comment_added"}
