{"actor":"agent:gpt5-reviewer","data":{"body":"Review completed against plan and diff. PASS. Implemented: CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml), root scripts (test/dashboard:lint/dashboard:build/check), Scenario 2 checker bug fix requiring Gizmo-Z=0, deterministic --seed sampling in src/index.ts, and regression test src/tasks/scenarios.test.ts. Verification: bun run check passed (94 tests, dashboard build successful). Determinism check passed: identical scenario sample order for --seed=123 across two runs; different order for --seed=321. Known residual: dashboard lint currently fails with pre-existing 58 errors; lint is tracked as advisory job to preserve signal without blocking this 1-day gate.","role":"review"},"id":"ev_01KJDZT7EKSN5BNT24WH3AGFMK","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJDZNV7XA5SM59N9KXR214VN","ts":"2026-02-26T22:06:22Z","type":"comment_added"}
