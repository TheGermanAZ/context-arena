{"actor":"human:german","data":{"body":"Combine RLM's targeted questions with Hybrid's narrative summary as a safety net. Two parallel calls: (1) RLM-style targeted extraction, (2) narrative summary. Inject both into context. This is what CorrectionAware v2 was converging toward. Hypothesis: RLM's targeted questions catch specifics that summaries drop, while the summary catches relationships that extraction destroys. Should beat both Hybrid (8/8) and RLM (7/8) individually \u2014 or at least match Hybrid with better scaling properties."},"id":"ev_01KJ8YBT9HXSBA92GMJBAXC1CH","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJ8YB4Q9B591WJ8KFG0V43S2","ts":"2026-02-24T23:04:49Z","type":"comment_added"}
