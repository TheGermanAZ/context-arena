{"actor":"human:german","data":{"body":"Current RLM uses depth 1 (one sub-LLM). Test depth 2: a sub-LLM summarizing a previous sub-LLM's output. Does accuracy collapse linearly or exponentially? Build a depth-N variant of RLMStrategy that chains delegation. Run on all scenarios at depth 1, 2, 3. This costs pennies and nobody has published depth-scaling curves for RLM."},"id":"ev_01KJ8YBFPTVVX1FSDD68CPG112","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJ8YB28ZEAYJM7D88K55GV0P","ts":"2026-02-24T23:04:38Z","type":"comment_added"}
