{"actor":"human:german","data":{"body":"RLM's 5 fixed questions (ENTITIES, DECISIONS, CORRECTIONS, NUMBERS, CURRENT STATE) are static. What if the questions were generated based on what the conversation is about? E.g. a recipe conversation generates 'list all ingredients with exact quantities' instead of generic 'list all numbers.' Use a cheap pre-pass to classify the conversation domain, then select from a question bank. Zero extra compute overhead if the classifier is rule-based."},"id":"ev_01KJ8YBKDXWQY2METQNAGSJAH7","schema_version":1,"task_id":"task_01KJ8YB31JR8V3TD4QDHDS5ZCY","ts":"2026-02-24T23:04:42Z","type":"comment_added"}
