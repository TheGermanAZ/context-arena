Implemented CTX-37 Stability-Plasticity + Quantity-Pinning probe v2. Changes: (1) Added quantity regexes to classifyStable() — currency, percentages, number+unit with conservative unit list. 24/24 probe recall, 0 false positives on noise text. (2) Rewrote Phase 2 to run both StabilityPlasticity and baseline RLM on all 8 scenarios (2 reps each = 32 runs). (3) Per-hypothesis kill criteria: H1 phone/id delta >= +15pp, H2 quantity delta >= +10pp, side effects threshold -15pp. Code reviewed — fixed type cast issues and expanded unit list per reviewer feedback. Tests: 25/25 pass.
