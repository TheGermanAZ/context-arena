# CTX-32: Add richer staged animations across all strategy diagrams

Enhance every strategy animation with additional staged motion during Play: (1) node pop-in/pulse timing for processor/model/memory blocks, (2) animated memory-state cues (e.g., payload growth / dropped-fact emphasis), and (3) optional-block and response emphasis. Apply these improvements to Full Context, Windowed, RLM, and shared GenericStrategyFlowAnimation so all strategies gain richer motion while still respecting reduced-motion settings.
