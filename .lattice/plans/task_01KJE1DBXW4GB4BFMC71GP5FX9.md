# CTX-25: Reorganize strategy animation section layout

Replace the long stacked animation list with a selector-driven layout: grouped strategy picker (Core vs Advanced) on the left and one active animation panel on the right. Keep all existing animation components, only change how they are presented for faster scanning and easier navigation.
